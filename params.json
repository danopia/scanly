{"name":"Scanly","tagline":"Web-oriented document scanner","body":"## Project Overview\r\nWe all know that printers are the spawn of the devil, and some of us may know of Google's work to contain the beast with Google Cloud Print. Cloud Print allows a printer to be connected to the cloud so that anyone with any modern computing device (and proper access) can print a document, without worrying about drivers.\r\n\r\nScanly is designed to replace the everyday scanning process. the same way Google Cloud Print replaced the printing process. A scanner is connected to \"the cloud\" using a connector, and then anyone with proper authorization can process photo, document, and multipage scan jobs right in their browser, device, or app.\r\n\r\nIf you want to scan documents with your Chromebook or driver-locked Windows desktop, then you've come to the right place.\r\n\r\nScanly is currently _in development_ and is not yet ready for usage, though contributions to the code is welcome. The connector is designed to work with SANE installs with scanners already set up. SANE is the popular Linux scanning system, and is already set up on Ubuntu and other popular distros.","google":"UA-48002021-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
